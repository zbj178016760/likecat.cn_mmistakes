## Abstract

- Background/objective
  - The reported incidence of scoliosis among adolescents in China differs according to screening method owing to the lack of uniformity and limitations of certain techniques. We aimed to design, develop, and validate a non-invasive, accurate, portable, fast, and automated tool that would enable the measurement and storage of data during scoliosis screening.

- Methods
  - We designed a new portable electronic scoliosis screening device (PESSD)â€”for the identification of adolescent scoliosis based on ergonomics theory. The device measured the axial deflection angle of the trunk of the human body using a built-in angle sensor. Data obtained using the PESSD, a traditional scoliometer manual ruler, and X-ray measurement of the Cobb angle were compared.

- Results
  - The PESSD exhibited more sensitive detection of small-angle scoliosis and improved repeatability compared with the scoliometer. The data obtained using the PESSD showed good correlation with Cobb angle data measured from X-ray images. All patients who were indicated to be positive for scoliosis using the PESSD were found to have clinically identifiable scoliosis from X-ray examination.

- Conclusions
  - The PESSD may be able to achieve early detection of scoliosis in adolescents. It is non-invasive, highly precise, portable, easy to use, and offers automated data storage and traceability. This study is a pilot or preliminary validation study. With further, more in depth studies, the PESSD has excellent potential for transformation into an effective tool for use in large-scale screening programs for adolescent scoliosis in schools and communities.

- The translational potential of this article
  - This article is about designing a new portable electronic scoliosis screening device based on ergonomics theory. Because there are currently no uniform screening methods and standards, the results in this article could facilitate the adoption of a uniform screening tool into large-scale screening programs for adolescent scoliosis in schools and communities, preliminary examination in hospitals, and self-testing at home after parent training.
