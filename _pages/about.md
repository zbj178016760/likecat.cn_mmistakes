![My Portrait](/assets/images/about-photo.jpg)

Ahoy there, fellow knowledge seeker! I'm currently donning my academic armor at 🏫 Xi'an Jiaotong University, embarking on a heroic 👨‍🎓 PhD journey in the enchanted realm of 👨‍🔧 Mechanical Engineering – think of me as the Gandalf of gears and gadgets, battling the Balrog of technical challenges.

💻 Coding and 📐 designing are my dynamic duo. I'm the Shakespeare of syntax, fluent in languages like Python, JavaScript, and maybe a bit of Klingon (okay, not really). My projects are a tech feast – a byte-sized buffet of innovation, with a side of easter eggs for the adventurous.

Creating 📰 websites and 📱 mobile apps is my digital playground. Currently, I'm on an epic quest to morph code into art using PyTorch – imagine Da Vinci, but with pixels. 🎨✨ It's like I'm crafting spells with my keyboard, turning 1s and 0s into pure magic. Hogwarts, eat your heart out!

Don't panic if my code looks like a Picasso painting. It's not a glitch; it's avant-garde programming – so cutting-edge that even my computer raises an eyebrow. 😜 It's the kind of code that leaves comments like "Is this genius or madness?" scattered throughout.

When I'm not battling bugs, I'm conquering virtual realms in the gaming universe. My gaming chair has seen more action than a Marvel movie marathon, but fear not – my virtual six-pack is intact. No gamer stereotypes here, just a warrior with a headset and a pixelated sword.

Not seeking sponsorship at the moment, but I am on a quest for tech companions. Let's be coding buddies, the Bonnie and Clyde of the programming world – minus the felonies. 🚀👩‍💻 Our code will echo through the digital ages! 💾🌌 Grab your keyboard, and let's write the next chapter of our digital saga!
